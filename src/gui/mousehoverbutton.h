/*
        Since Qt tool button pushes icon's image for pressed state, we have own implementation.
        To get it properly worked next images should be assigned to
        next button states programmatically or in the Qt designer:
        Normal Off - default image
        Normal On - clicked image
        Disabled Off - disabled image
        Disabled On - disabled image
        Active Off - hover image
        Active On - hover image
        Selected Off - default image
        Selected On - default image
